        content: '<div class="bloc1"><p>You may ask, why do we need to resolve concerns in the first place?</p><p>Problem-solving is an important skill that each organization needs to have when managing a community. That’s because issues can arise anytime a person experiences difficulty navigating different areas such as websites, applications, products, and community processes. A way to work with constructive feedbacks and criticism also have to be taken account as part of this skill.</p><p>In the world of web3, it’s even more important that we have a team that dedicates their time accommodating community members because of all these new concepts, services, and products that are continuously built on the blockchain. Integrating Community Support role in an organization can bridge understanding towards a new internet culture while allowing community members foster positive relationships. It can also help an organization streamline processes and grow their audience reach in the long term.</p><p>These outcomes sure do sound great on paper. But, to make it a reality, we’ve prepared some guidelines with <strong>5 steps in resolving a community member’s concerns. This can help the Community Support team confidently handle the situation whenever it arises.*</strong></p><p>*If a member asks a concern that is out of the organization’s control, it is necessary to clarify that it is not in your capacity to solve that problem, but still try your best to make them feel understood.</p></div>'

In our “Steps to Resolution” lesson, you may recall that the nature of concern can be categorized for easier referencing. Some of the ways the Community Support team can anticipate those concerns include the use of platform analytics and surveys. </p><p>As an example, you can go to Discord’s <em>Server Insights</em> found in the server settings. This lets you see what community members are mostly focusing on using the server’s growth retention, engagement rate, audience demographics, and channel interactions. You can also use Discord bots to set auto-response messages for keywords or phrases that are commonly used. Another way is to help other departments conduct surveys for novel projects. Objective results can show which areas of the platforms need better community support and documentation, while subjective results can show the general sentiment of the community.</p></div><div class="bloc2"><img src=\'/humanDAO/lesson/best-practices/best-practice-1-use-data-to-understand-your-community-050b5ab5.png\'></div>'

        content: '<div class="bloc1"><p>Communication can be tricky. However, it is always possible to make organization\'s systems well-understood and followed. To get right information to the right people at the right time, it’s necessary to standardize information using handoff procedures.</p><p>In short, a handoff is the process of letting someone else take care of things you could have taken care of with sufficient documentation and resources. When someone else is designated with your role, they are taking the handoff. So how can you prepare handoff procedures for succeeding contributors? Here are some ways to do it effectively:</p><ul><li>Prepare a checklist of your day-to-day tasks and processes</li><li>Give a report on the latest tasks that were done and what needs to be handed off, as well as current issues and challenges that you face</li><li>Give some ideas on how you think those issues can be resolved</li><li>Link all the necessary resources needed for the task</li></ul></div><div class="bloc2"><img src=\'/humanDAO/lesson/best-practices/best-practice-3-comply-with-handoff-procedures-3faf338d.png\'></div>'

More often that not, organizations have their dedicated social media channels to post announcements for the community, while team members have dedicated department channels on Discord and Slack for project updates and handoff. On top of that, each application in the organization’s tech stack also has updates on new features, maintenance, and outages situated in websites and social channels.</p><p>To make sure you are on top of these announcements, you can try to use the following strategies:</p><ul><li>Use a private Discord server for your Community Support team to follow updates from your tech stack’s Support Server announcements</li><li>Turn on email or SMS notifications for form responses</li><li>Use low-code to no-code integration platforms like Zapier or Pipedream to automate updates</li></ul></div><div class="bloc2"><img src=\'/humanDAO/lesson/best-practices/best-practice-4-stay-updated-with-official-announcements--05a1eca8.png\'></div>'
